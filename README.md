### Each time a question is answered, an AJAX request is made to the Giphy API based on a keyword related to the question.  If a GIF is found, it will display on the screen.  You never know what you will get!

### At the end of the game, you have the option of playing again.  If your score is higher than one of the top 5 scores, you can enter your initials on the leaderboard.  Your score will persist on your local machine by being stored in local storage.
